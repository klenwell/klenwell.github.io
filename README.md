## Note on Hosting

This site was originally be hosted on a Linode VPS for several years for $10/mo, which was already overpriced for the amount of resources being used.

In 2022, [Akamai acquired Linode](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30352772). In April 2023, Akamai raised the monthly hosting fee $2, which finally inspired me to move the site to Github Pages.
